# AMD PACE - AMD Platform Aware Compute Engine

AMD PACE is a high-performance LLM inference engine built from the ground up for AMD EPYC CPUs. It is a PyTorch C++ extension that combines custom AVX512 kernels, CPU-native KV cache management, and a production-ready serving stack to deliver maximum throughput on AMD server-class hardware.

🔥 **Check out our latest blog post: [AMD PACE - A vLLM Plugin for CPU Inference](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/resources/technical-articles/2026/amd-pace-integrates-with-vllm.html)** — how PACE plugs into vLLM as a CPU platform plugin: a single `pip install pace-vllm`, no application code changes, routing vLLM's CPU worker through PACE's SLAB attention, tuned Linear/RMSNorm operators, and fused MLP on 5th Gen AMD EPYC™ processors.

📦 **Now available on PyPI** — `pip install amd-pace` (and `pip install pace-vllm` for the [vLLM plugin](packages/pace_vllm/README.md)). Pre-built **manylinux wheels** for Python 3.10 – 3.13; no compiler required.

> NOTE: AMD PACE is designed and tested for systems with AVX512 or higher support. On systems lacking AVX512, performance may degrade significantly due to fallback to slower reference implementations, or the library might not function as intended.

## Highlights

* **vLLM Plugin (`pace-vllm`)** — A drop-in [vLLM platform plugin](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/design/plugin_system.html) that routes vLLM's CPU worker through PACE's kernels and SlabPool KV cache, with no changes to your existing vLLM scripts. Replaces vLLM's CPU attention backend, KV cache, and Linear/RMSNorm layers with PACE equivalents; under compile mode also fuses gated/ungated MLP blocks into a single `pace::libxsmm_fused_mlp` call. Lets you keep the vLLM API and get PACE's CPU performance underneath. More in [packages/pace_vllm/README.md](packages/pace_vllm/README.md).

* **SlabPool Attention** — A CPU-native KV cache and attention backend engineered for AMD EPYC processors. SlabPool manages all sequences in a single pre-allocated BF16 tensor with O(1) slab allocation, L2-aware block sizing, and a unified attention dispatcher that selects the optimal kernel path per sequence — GQA-aware decode with online softmax, multi-token decode, or tiled prefill — all within one OMP dispatch. Handles offline and online inference, continuous batching, sliding window, and sink attention through a single entry point. More in [SlabAttention.md](docs/SlabAttention.md).

* **Inference Server** — `pace-server` provides a full serving stack with a router/engine architecture, continuous batching, multi-instance NUMA-aware execution, and built-in metrics. The launcher automatically partitions CPU cores across engine instances and binds memory to the local NUMA node for optimal data locality. More in [InferenceServer.md](docs/InferenceServer.md).

* **Paged Attention** — An implementation of [vLLM-style paged KV cache](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) on CPU. Memory is allocated in fixed-size pages, eliminating fragmentation from variable-length sequences and enabling efficient memory sharing. Fully integrated with the PACE serving stack and all supported models.

* **Fused AVX512 Kernels** — PACE ships a suite of fused operators that eliminate intermediate memory traffic and keep data in registers/cache: fused Add+RMSNorm and Add+LayerNorm, fused RoPE, fused QKV projections, and a fused MLP kernel (via TPP/libXSMM). These are the default operators for all supported models.

* **Broad Model Support** — Llama (up to 3.3), Qwen2/2.5, Phi3/4, Gemma 3, GPT-J, OPT, and GPT-OSS, all running in BF16 with the same operator and backend framework. Adding a new architecture is a single-file effort. More in [LLM.md](docs/LLM.md).

* **Speculative Decoding (PARD)** — Built-in PARallel Draft Model Adaptation that runs a smaller draft model ahead of the target, verifying speculated tokens in a single parallel forward pass. PARD can deliver up to 5x throughput improvement over standard autoregressive decoding. More in [SpeculativeDecoding.md](docs/SpeculativeDecoding.md).

## Installation

AMD PACE provides pre-built **manylinux wheels** on PyPI — the simplest install path, no compiler needed. Building from source is supported for developers and bleeding-edge users.

### From PyPI (recommended)

1. **Create a Python 3.12 env with miniforge.** Install miniforge from [here](https://conda-forge.org/miniforge/), then:
   ```
   conda create -n pace-env-py3.12 python=3.12 -y
   conda activate pace-env-py3.12
   ```

   > AMD PACE is tested on Python 3.10 – 3.13; Python 3.12 is the most thoroughly exercised version.

2. **Install CPU PyTorch.** The `+cpu` build is not published on PyPI, so it needs PyTorch's index:
   ```
   pip install --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu torch==2.12.0+cpu
   ```

3. **Install amd-pace:**
   ```
   pip install amd-pace
   ```

### From source (developers)

> NOTE: Building from source requires gcc>=12 and make. On Ubuntu: `sudo apt install build-essential gcc-12 g++-12`.

1. **Create an env** — see [From PyPI](#from-pypi-recommended) above.

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Build AMD PACE from source:**
    ```
    pip install -r build_requirements.txt [-v] .
    ```
    This will build AMD PACE and install it in the current environment. The `-v` option is optional and can be used to enable verbose output during the build process.

    > NOTE: It uses the new way of building packages with `pip`, for more details refer to [PEP 517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/). The `build_requirements.txt` should be passed in during installation to ensure that the build environment is set up correctly, please refer to [PEP 518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/) for more details.

    For developers who need to build AMD PACE frequently, using pip with `--no-build-isolation` is recommended to avoid unnecessary overhead of creating isolated environments for each build. This speeds up the build process significantly. Make sure to have all the required dependencies installed in your environment before using this option.
    ```
    pip install --no-build-isolation [-v] .
    ```

    > NOTE: Building AMD PACE, especially the oneDNN component, can require significant memory. If your system does not have enough RAM, the build process may fail or your machine may run out of memory.
